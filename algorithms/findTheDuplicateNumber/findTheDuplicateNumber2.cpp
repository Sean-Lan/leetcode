 *
 * Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.
 *
 * Note:
 * You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
 * You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
 * Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
 * There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.
